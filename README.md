>>import thing :
1.Before you run the test , make sure you have already install git environment.
2.Need internet to download the test skeleton

standard env : mac_os 
python version: 3.6.5 or higher

you just need to follow me and don't need to change anything!

first step:
    put your assn1 file at current directory which is 9024_assn1
    need two files here: listIteratorInt.c and listIteratorInt.h

second step:
    Use the cd command to go to the current directory.
    and run command < python3 test.py >

final step:
    check the output result in final_report.html and console.



//  Happy New Year  :)

tests.log is yours output  it shows all the process which the program does.

<ALL TEST PASS > means your function execute without error
But it doesn't means your result is right so you still need check the final_report.html
